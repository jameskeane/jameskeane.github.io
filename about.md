This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Balzac](https://github.com/coletownsend/balzac-for-jekyll) theme, and hosted by [Github](http://pages.github.com/).

### Who?
My name is [James](http://jameskeane.ca), and I am a Software Developer.  I grew up in [Toronto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto). Started my career as a Compiler Developer, and switched to web.  I like making [websites](/sites) and [programming languages](https://github.com/jameskeane/ham-script).  

### Why?
* Life is stressful, writing is cathartic.
* Exposure for my apps.
* Do things, write about them.

### The Name
Why _Nomad_? The name came about from dreaming of a passive income, and travelling the world.  This is my goal, and some day I hope to become the Nomad.
