Google, the all knowing, all powerful web being; The keeper of referrals, and holder of impressions. What must we do to appease this mighty tome of knowledge? How do we get our site on the front page? Let's find out ...

###Google's Algorithms
Google uses [Page Rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) to figure out if your site is valuable. In a nut shell, PR is determined by how many high PR backlinks a site has. If you can get good backlinks, you are doing alright.

I won't go into detail about how each algorithm works because it isn't needed unless you are trying to game the system. Google constantly [releases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda) [updates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin) to their algorithms that will catch you if you try to game them. Don't do this, be honest and you won't have to worry about what algorithms are doing what.

### SEO
Rather than making another article about SEO, and what you need to do. I recommend using a tool like [WooRank](http://www.woorank.com/), that will recommend improvements you can make to increase your site's SEO.

SEO is very, very important. If you don't have good SEO, you will not rank easily. Save yourself a lot of time now, rather than fighting your poorly optimized site later.

### Analytics and Webmaster Tools
Get yourself set up with [Google Analytics](http://www.google.ca/analytics/) and [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools).  Webmaster Tools will allow you to manually request an index of your site, which is good. But the biggest improvement will come from linking.

### Post, baby, post
Now get your site out there, you have done all your homework. You have a product people want to buy.

> Let your customer's know you exist!

Post your site to relevant forums, aggregators, subreddits. Try not to overdo it, as ranking on one high value site will have a ripple effect through the web.

With [Bespeak](https://www.bespeak.io/), I only posted to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), yet referrals were coming in from twitter! The web loves consuming content, and you must pick your submissions wisely.

### Don't loose hope
You probably won't rank immediately, I had to wait about 4 days to get on the second page of my target query. Not great, but it is encouraging. This is a sign you are doing something right, and should keep going. Just keep going, talk about your site. Ask a few satisfied users to post on twitter or facebook.
